# Math formulas
## Area
- Circle: S = πR²
- Rectangle: S = ab
- Square: S = a²

## Perimeter
- Circle: P = 2πR
- Rectangle: P = 2a + 2b
- Square: P = 4a


## Rectangle area and perimeter

### Description
The area function takes two arguments, a and b, and returns the area of a rectangle with sides a and b. The perimeter function takes two arguments, a and b, and returns the perimeter of a rectangle with sides a and b.

### Usage
The area function can be used to calculate the area of a rectangle by providing the length and width of the rectangle as arguments. Similarly, the perimeter function can be used to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle by providing the length and width of the rectangle as arguments.

## Example

area(2, 3)
### Output: 6

perimeter(2, 3)
### Output: 10


## Testing
The code includes two test classes, TestArea and TestPerimeter, which can be used to test the area and perimeter functions respectively. Each test class includes several test cases that check if the functions return the expected output for different input values. 

To run the tests, simply execute the code in a Python environment that supports the unittest module.
