# Geometric Lib
## Supports working with 4 geometric figures:
- circle
- rectangle
- square
- triangle

### 1) Circle
- `def area(r)` receives *the radius* of the circle and returns it's area, calculated by the formula **S = πR<sup>2</sup>**
- `def perimeter(r)` receives *the radius* of the circle and returns it's perimeter, calculated by the formula **P = 2πR**

### 2) Rectangle
- `def area(a, b)` receives *the length of sides* of the rectangle and returns it's area, calculated by the formula **S = a * b**
- `def perimeter(a, b)` receives *the length of sides* of the rectangle and returns it's perimeter, calculated by the formula **P = 2 * (a + b)**

### 3) Square
- `def area(a)` receives *the length of side* of the square and returns it's area, calculated by the formula **S = a<sup>2</sup>**
- `def perimeter(a)` receives *the length of side* of the square and returns it's perimeter, calculated by the formula **P = 4 * a**

### 4) Triangle
- `def area(a, h)` receives *the length of the triangle base* and *it's height* and returns area, calculated by the formula **S = a * (h / 2)**
- `def perimeter(a, b, c)` receives *the length of all triangle's sides*  and returns it's perimeter, calculated by the formula **P = a + b + c**
